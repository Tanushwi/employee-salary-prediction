# üíº Employee Salary Prediction ‚Äì Project Overview

This project is focused on predicting the salary of employees based on input factors such as years of experience, education level, and job title. It uses a machine learning approach, specifically **Linear Regression**, to estimate salaries. The goal is to assist HR professionals, recruiters, and even job seekers in understanding fair compensation standards in the job market.


## üß† Problem Statement

Determining the appropriate salary for an individual based on their qualifications and experience can be challenging, especially when companies lack a standardized system. Salary discrepancies and biases often arise during recruitment. The aim of this project is to build a predictive model that uses historical employee data to estimate the salary of new candidates. By analyzing key features like education, experience, and job roles, the model can provide salary predictions that help in fair decision-making.


## üõ†Ô∏è System Development Approach

The system is built using Python and leverages well-known libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. The development process includes collecting data, cleaning and preprocessing it, analyzing key trends, training a regression model, and finally evaluating its performance.

The major steps involved are:
- **Data Collection**: A dataset containing employee attributes and their corresponding salaries was used.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Categorical data (like education and job title) was encoded, and missing values were handled to prepare the dataset for model training.
- **Model Training**: A Linear Regression model was trained on a portion of the data.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model‚Äôs accuracy was evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R¬≤ score.


## üìä Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Experience**: Total years of work experience.
- **Education**: Educational qualification (e.g., Bachelors, Masters, PhD).
- **Job Title**: Role of the employee.
- **Salary**: Actual annual salary.

Each of these factors contributes to the prediction of an employee‚Äôs salary. Categorical values were handled through encoding to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.


## üìà Results and Analysis

The trained model performed reasonably well, with a good balance between simplicity and accuracy. The **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** indicated how close the predictions were to the actual salaries, while the **R¬≤ score** showed how well the model explained the variation in salary values. On a small dataset, the model achieved around **65% accuracy**, which is considered acceptable for a basic Linear Regression model.


## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The Employee Salary Prediction model provides a data-driven approach to estimate salaries based on consistent factors. While it may not replace human judgment entirely, it serves as a valuable tool to support salary decisions and reduce bias. The project showcases how machine learning can be practically applied to solve real-world problems using basic algorithms.


## üöÄ Future Scope

This model can be further improved by:

- Using larger and more diverse datasets
- Adding more features like job location, company size, or industry
- Exploring advanced models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Deep Learning
- Deploying the model as a web application for user-friendly interaction
